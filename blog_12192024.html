                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">Okay, so this one is gonna be hella rough and short because it's almost 4am, but I thought I'd at least get a first blog post out to start haha. Literally this whole page right now is inline html with styles added into the header and paragraph tags lol. Anyway though, I think I've been working on this site for almost a month(?) on and off now and progress has been super slow, but I feel like I've really started picking it up a lot more recently.</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I really have no explicit goals for this website other than to just have fun and maybe use it as a portfolio/e-commerce thingy if I actually make some shit with any value in the future--hopefully I do :P. The other reason I think was basically to get my foot in the door for generally learning how to code so I can work my way up to learning game development on Unreal Engine V (lots of game ideas that will hopefully materialize somehow but I'm sure my scope is way too big lol.) I know my goal for early January is to get the shop page set up, so that should be cool. It definitely won't be fancy because I doubt I'll actually have the motivation to learn backend and Javascript, but I'll make it where I can at least get order requests for certain items for people with my Venmo or something attached.</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I don't know, I have a ton of lofty goals, especially in the months leading up to April when I move up to Alaska for the seasonal job with the sled doggies :3 Anyway, good night, I need sleep unfortunately.</p>
