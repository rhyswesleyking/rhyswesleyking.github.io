            <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">02/27/2025</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">Yesterday I cried at work. I felt like everything I was doing was wrong, inconveniencing my coworkers, and that I was too slow to be working this job. It was incredibly embarassing, but honestly...? Needed.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I've lived in so much [emotional] comfort for the past few years that maybe this job was the push I needed to learn how to be more resilient. I won't lie and say that I like this job, but I think one of my coworkers (the one who caused me to cry, not her fault)made me realize a few important things. No matter how bad you fuck up, it's really not the end of the world, and as long as the customer gets the food, don't kill yourself over being as quick as possible.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">As much as I hate life right now, the pain I'm going through currently is going to lead to something better. Alaska is waiting, and I can do this.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">- Rhys</p>
