            <h3 style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">04/03/2025</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I don't know why I'm writing to be honest, nothing notable has happened in my life for the past month. Guess I'm just trying to keep in the "habit."</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">Currently at work. It's slow. That always seems to be the time I remember that this journal exists. I guess recently though I've finally kind of figured out some life shit, that being I'm saving up to immigrate to somewhere in the Schengen area. Trying to build up tech skills in some way or maybe I'll finish a degree here to give myself a better chance.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;"><del>Definitely</del> Probably won't move down to Florida with my parents and sister--</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: rgb(246, 255, 0);"><em>*Got cut off finishing this because we got an influx of customers and then had to finish closing. Gonna finish my thought here (04/05/2025)*</em></p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;"><b>*04/05/2025*</b></p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">In a way I'll probably use this post to organize my thoughts on what I want to do with my life in the next few years (assuming the squishy orange one doesn't completely destroy the country/means to get out by the midterms.)</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">Originally I had intended to pick a specific country and just start the immigration process once I had a solid remote job lined up or something similar. Considering how fast the U.S. is declining though in just the few months since Trump was sworn in, I feel like I need to move <em>way faster</em> to actually have a solid chance of escaping before it gets really ugly. That being said, I think this will probably be my new plan:</p>
            <ol style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">
                <li>Create an online freelance business (likely music comp/prod for video games)</li>
                <li>Find other ways to make money (ex. DJing, dogsitting/walking, selling prints) on the side to save up for relocation and/or an emergency fund</li>
                <li><del>Once</del> If I start making at least $2,000/mo net revenue from the freelance business I'll quit my min. wage job to travel for a while in lower cost countries</li>
                <li>After traveling for a while I'll hopefully have a good idea of where I want to settle, or if (by the grace of the universe) Trump/the conservatives are removed from office and it's safe again, I might return to the States.</li>
            </ol>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">If things really get dire though, I don't think I could leave my grandma and a few other family members. I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something horrible happened. With how much protesting is happening, maybe the tides will turn and the current administration will be removed, but I'm not holding my breath. I don't know, the world is just really scary right now and I feel so powerless about so many things.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I'm not the type to go to protests or anything loud, but I'm doing what I can. I only buy what I need from companies I support locally, trying to use cash more often, most things I buy second hand where possible, trying to get more involved with community, etc. Honestly, I'm just tired of this world. Not in the sense that I want to end my life, but moreso I know that it could be so much better and we let such a small group of individuals destroy both the planet and the right to just live freely and peacefully. That was kind of a long tangent, but it's all connected in my opinion. The world is fucked, but I can't let that destroy my joy. Have to learn how to be happy in spite of everything.</p>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; color: white;">I guess that's about it. I can't sit at my computer all day lamenting about the problems of the world, time to start living in it. Whoever reads this and feels similarly, you're not alone. <3</p>
