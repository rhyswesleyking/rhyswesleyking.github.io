## Hello! 

You've stumbled upon my website's github page :) Link back to my main website [here](rhyswesleyking.github.io).

My name is Rhys. I'm nobody special, just someone who wanted to learn computers a little bit more and got really invested in learning video game/web development. Not really much to see here other than my sh!tty code and the source files used to build it. Progress is slow but I'm mostly just doing this for fun! Overall I want this to be a giant hub of all of my projects, media, or anything else I do--because I literally cannot pick what I want to do with my life! Lol. Below should be a general list of what I'm aiming to do, what I like, and what I hope to accomplish with this particular project.

## What I'm About:
- Game Dev
- Web Dev
- VGM Composition
- Audio/Music Production
- Filmmaking
- Photography
- Travel/Car Camping (okay..."vanlife" lol)

## Goals for this website:
1. To be used as a portfolio
2. E-commerce store (or at least a link to it
3. Public diary/journal of my experiences
4. Hub that links to other social platforms

### Thanks for stopping by this ReadMe, and feel free to look through my site!
