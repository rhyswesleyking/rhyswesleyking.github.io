    <p class="mwf">Hello! My name is Rhys King and I'm a visual artist from Richmond, Virginia. I specialize in cinematography and editing. I held an internship at Christopher Newport University for three years working with the school videographer as well as teaching myself the basics during the 2020 pandemic. While my expertise mainly lies in film, I'm also photographer with experience in many different genres. Additionally, I'm in the process of learning sound design as well as DJing. Feel free to look through my work and send me a message if you would like any of my services.</p>
